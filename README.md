# EasyC

## WTF!? Where is everything?

All development of EasyC is done on the gh-pages branch nowadays, since we want GitHub to host it for us.

Basically, Isaac wrote the new version of EasyC in the saasrobotics/Robotics2013-14 repo, but we wanted to transition back to saasrobotics/easyc. So this branch contains the version history of the first version of EasyC, the EasyC2 branch of saasrobotics/Robotics2013-14 contains the first part of the history of the next-generation EasyC, and the gh-pages branch of saasrobotics/easyc contains the second part of the next-generation EasyC.
